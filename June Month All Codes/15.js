// Bitwise NOT Operator ~

let a = 10;
let b = ~a;
// b = -11
// Maths Formula = -(n + 1)



// Computer Thinks This

/*
let a = 10;
Bit of a is = 1010
Adding - sign which means Inverting Bits = 1010 will be now 0101
Now add +1 to that value

0101

2's Complement = 1's Complement + 1 

Again Inverting Bit

0101
1010
   1
-----
1011  = 11
-----
If 1 is MSB then its negative
If 0 is MSB then its positive
